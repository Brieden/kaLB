# Lattice Boltzmann Method for Fluid Simulations

This repository contains the project work form Sven Brieden(Briedens@uni-marburg.de) for the lecture Scientific Software Development by Jan Oliver Oelerich(jan.oliver.oelerich@physik.uni-marburg.de).
 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The project has just been started so there is not much to explain yet.

### Prerequisites
To get a quick introduction to the topic of LBM, I recommend you to look at the LBM_first_try.ipynb. This document contains both physical explanations and executable code. This file is written and tested with Jupyter notebooks and Python 3.6.4
