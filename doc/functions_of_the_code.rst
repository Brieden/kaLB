hdf5_to_mpeg.py
===============
.. warning::
    ffmpeg is required for this program.
    Please make sure before using hdf5_to_mpeg that ffmpeg is installed on your system.

:Parameters: **hdf5 path** â€” As command line parameter the path to hdf5 of the simulation is required.

hdf5_to_mpeg is a tool to make a video from a hdf5 file generated by the Lattice Boltzmann Simulation code kaLB.

This tool helps you to make a video out of a simulation.
In the process, images are created using matplotlib and videos are created from the images using ffmpeg.
To speed up the process of creating images, multithreading is used.
From the hdf5 files the density and the speed are read out and displayed in two independent videos.
The plot settings are adapted for the kaLB example simulation and can be customized in the code for the desired problem.
